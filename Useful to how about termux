## Terminal Shortcuts and Navigation

Termux provides several shortcuts and navigation options to help you work efficiently within the terminal:

- Use the `Tab` key for auto-completion. It saves time by suggesting commands, paths, and filenames as you type.

- Press `Ctrl + C` to terminate a running command or process.

- To clear the terminal screen, use the `clear` command or press `Ctrl + L`.

- Use the `cd` command to navigate the file system. For example, `cd /sdcard` takes you to the root of your device's external storage.

- To go back to the previous directory, use `cd -`.

- Use the `ls` command to list files and directories. Adding the `-l` flag (`ls -l`) provides a detailed view with additional information like permissions and file sizes.

## Termux Extras: Tools and Extensions

Termux can be extended with additional tools and extensions to enhance its functionality. Here are a few popular ones:

- **Termux API**: Allows you to access various device features and sensors from within Termux, such as the camera, microphone, contacts, and more.

- **Termux Styling**: Customize the appearance of your terminal emulator with different color schemes and fonts.

- **Termux Float**: Enables a floating terminal window that stays on top of other apps, providing quick access to Termux while multitasking.

- **Termux Widget**: Create home screen widgets that execute specific commands or scripts with a single tap.

You can install these extras using the APT package manager. For example, to install the Termux API package, use the command `pkg install termux-api`.

## Termux and Termux:API
